ADVICE

- When writing in a volatile variable, all previously written into variables are flushed to RAM 
  (happens-before property of volatile variables)
- XML processing is unsafe
- Even if two or more methods are synchronized, their combinations are not
- Use reentrant read write lock when reading is different from writing
- Prefer immutable data structires to synchronization
